# STAR BUS

The aim of our project is to create a way to be able to see various bus times from the nearest stops without needing to check each individually every time, the idea is to use a Raspberry Pi and a screen which will communicate with a telephone app.

Using a router as a server, the Raspberry Pi checks the bus times constantly whilst the Telephone app enables us to easily change the chosen bus stops and also change the server IP and Port.
